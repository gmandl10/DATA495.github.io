This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(earth)
master<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\gmandl\\Documents\\GitHub\\DATA495.github.io\\Data\\NHANES\\master_depression.csv")
```

```{r}
master2 <- drop_na(master)
rownames(master2) <- as.integer(master2$SEQN)
master2 <- master2 |> select(-SEQN)
smp_size<-floor(0.75*nrow(master2))
train_ind <- sort(sample(nrow(master2), nrow(master2)*.7))

train <- master2[train_ind, ]
test <- master2[-train_ind,]
```

```{r}
mars1 <- earth(
  DepressionScore ~ ., data = train
)

print(mars1)
```
